![Computational Framework](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3a48bf62-95e6-4e15-8d81-49387df80be1)

A computational framework is a structured, often modular system of tools, algorithms, and methodologies designed to support the development, implementation, and execution of computational models and simulations. It provides the necessary infrastructure for integrating theoretical principles with numerical methods, enabling researchers to model, analyze, and predict the behavior of complex systems in a consistent and scalable manner. The custom GPT [Computational Framework](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-67b4d3c629c08191becbe614b7ee88df-computational-framework) was created to assist in theoretical computational modeling across a variety of scientific and technical domains. It helps users build and refine mathematical models, implement simulations, perform parameter analysis, and interpret results using computational tools. By guiding users through step-by-step multiple-choice queries, it ensures a clear and logical workflow for constructing models and exploring hypotheses. Whether applied to physics, chemistry, biology, economics, or social sciences, this GPT leverages computational theory to deepen understanding and accelerate discovery by making abstract or large-scale phenomena more accessible and analyzable through simulation and algorithmic processing.

![Einstein's Humanoid](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3e7e548e-da6f-4608-b644-0fc00e1d84d9)

Theoretical computer science (TCS) is a branch of computer science that focuses on abstract and mathematical aspects of computation, including the formalization, analysis, and classification of computational problems and models. It studies the limits of what can be computed, how efficiently problems can be solved, and the fundamental structures that underpin algorithms, data, and computation itself. A theoretical computer science model is a formal framework used to represent and reason about computation; common models include Turing machines, finite automata, pushdown automata, Boolean circuits, lambda calculus, and formal grammars, each offering distinct perspectives on computational power and complexity. These models serve to rigorously define classes of computable functions, analyze computational resources like time and space, and investigate decidability and reducibility among problems. [Theoretical Computer Science](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-6835d19e83488191be7b15a06f8f5e1c-theoretical-computer-science)  specializes in the research and development of such models by leveraging a deep understanding of formal systems and computational theory to construct, analyze, and refine abstract models, perform complexity analysis, simulate machine behavior, propose reductions, evaluate decidability, and investigate cryptographic or algorithmic assumptions. It supports users in developing novel frameworks, comparing computational paradigms, and generating rigorous definitions, formal proofs, and comparative analyses with academic-level precision.

![Theoretical Framework](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/702d2f50-6a71-4b83-af68-370407bb551e)

[Theoretical Framework](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-67b590732a98819192ae5cd5f60bac85-theoretical-framework) was made to assist users in constructing, refining, or understanding theoretical frameworks within academic and research contexts. A theoretical framework is a foundational structure in scholarly research that organizes and links concepts, variables, and constructs to explain phenomena or guide empirical inquiry. It draws from existing theories, models, and prior research to provide a coherent lens through which a study is conceptualized, hypotheses are formulated, and data is interpreted. By situating the research within a specific theoretical context—such as psychological, sociological, economic, or political theories—a theoretical framework not only justifies the research design and methodology but also enhances the study's rigor and relevance. This GPT facilitates this process by helping users identify appropriate theories, articulate relationships between variables, and ensure alignment between research questions, objectives, and theoretical underpinnings.

![Homelab](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/34d98c3c-53a2-4763-89f2-163eb9a91b7b)

[Homelab Interface](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-682c30980c7481918170b5a18a3ef72a-homelab-interface) was made to help users develop and manage terminal-style control programs for their homelab environments—personal server or network setups used for self-hosted services, testing, learning, and automation. Its core function is to assist in scripting and building efficient command-line interfaces (CLIs) that interact with a range of systems and services, such as servers, virtual machines, containers (like Docker or Podman), storage devices, and network equipment. A homelab control program is essentially a lightweight, scriptable tool—often written in Python or Bash—that allows users to automate and streamline routine tasks like monitoring system resources, restarting services, managing deployments, running updates, or accessing logs, all through simple terminal commands. This GPT guides users step-by-step through the design, modularization, and implementation of such programs, ensuring they include key features like error handling, remote access via SSH, resource monitoring using libraries like psutil, and optional cloud integration through APIs like AWS Boto3. It emphasizes creating secure, user-friendly tools with clear feedback, logging, and documentation to make managing homelabs efficient, scalable, and accessible directly from the terminal.

Also, [Homelab Theory](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-682c30980c7481918170b5a18a3ef72a-homelab-interface) was created to assist with the conceptualization, development, and optimization of advanced homelab environments that mirror professional research and development facilities within a domestic or small-group context. Uniquely, it integrates interdisciplinary knowledge across computer engineering, electrical engineering, advanced networking, software development, machine learning, and embedded systems, enabling users to architect modular, scalable infrastructures using commodity or repurposed hardware. It supports operating systems fine-tuned for container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes or OpenStack, emphasizes automated scripting for deployment and monitoring, and incorporates secure identity management with LDAP or Kerberos. Homelab Theory distinguishes itself by helping users create complex systems that unify cyber-physical experimentation, digital fabrication, and immersive technologies—such as robotics, IoT, AR/VR, and scientific modeling—while remaining grounded in open-source tools and cost-effective solutions. Its purpose is not only technical guidance but also educational empowerment, offering step-by-step, multiple-choice-based pathways to mastery of high-level system integration, experimentation, and grassroots innovation.

![Eval Sim](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4109b622-5c93-4bc0-8290-d252fd21f650)

[Evaluation Sim](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-685f8f4e0e5c8191aef313a300e71c49-evaluation-sim) is a custom GPT created test and analyze multiple experimental scenarios in a virtual environment. Instead of relying solely on physical trials—which can be time-consuming, expensive, and limited in scope—Eval Sim enables researchers to define key parameters and automatically generate a wide array of conditions to explore. This includes varying input variables, applying constraints, and establishing different goal states. Once these setups are defined, the simulation engine runs each scenario, mimicking real-world responses through computational models or logic-based approximations. This allows for rapid, large-scale experimentation with minimal resource expenditure.

The true strength of an Eval Sim lies in its analytical capabilities. After completing all simulation runs, it aggregates and processes the results to uncover patterns, correlations, and anomalies. This structured analysis helps researchers quickly pinpoint optimal conditions, understand trade-offs, and identify unexpected behaviors that might otherwise go unnoticed. Whether applied in scientific research, engineering design, policy analysis, or business strategy, Eval Sim provides a scalable and robust toolset for evidence-based decision-making. Its flexibility and efficiency significantly enhance the depth and quality of insights available from complex systems.
